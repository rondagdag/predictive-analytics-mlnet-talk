# Predictive Maintenance - ML.NET and MAUI

Predicting the future is not easy! Forecasting peak operating conditions and avoiding unexpected equipment breakdown is possible, thatâ€™s the goal of Predictive Maintenance. Attend this session and learn how to train a machine learning model in Visual Studio with ML.NET Model Builder, and build an app that uses the model. Fair warning - I cannot predict how live demos would go. I will do my best.

## Demo: ModelBuilder and AutoML
In this example you find a .NET MAUI application that can be used for predictive maintenance.
